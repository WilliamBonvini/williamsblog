### Overview

*EESTEC* (Electrical Engineering STudents' European assoCiation) organizes an engineering competition every year.   
In 2022 the competition topic was *machine learning applications*, so my colleagues at  [Machine Learning Reply](https://www.reply.com/machine-learning-reply/it/) and I organized a hackathon for them:  An image classification task on 3D printed objects. 

##### Dataset

The dataset comprised of images of objects created via a 3D printer.   
Some objects were defect free, some others presented well known types of [3D printer defects](https://additive-x.com/blog/7-common-3d-printing-problems-with-solutions/).
