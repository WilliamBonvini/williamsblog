This blogpost wants to be a summary of what I've learnt about topic modeling techniques so far. I plan on upating the content of this post any time I stumble upon new tools. Feel free to contact me. this could become a GitHub repository. 

Here I will focus on any techniques that relies on creating words and document embeddings and perform any kind o dimensionanility reduction and clustering technique to identify topics, defined as ordered lists of words. This is to say that I won't cover any new generative approach that relies on GPT-4 or other competitors, but I'm sure they offer some interesting results.
