Popular game.   
Memory is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn.   
The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

##### Shopping Cart

In this supermarket-themed game, players control a shopping cart and are presented with a recipe. As they navigate the supermarket aisles, ingredients rain down from above, and the goal is to catch only the items that belong to the recipe by moving the cart on the x-axis.


##### Key Whole

This game presents a door with a lock and a variety of keys with different shapes. The objective is to select and repeatedly use the correct key to unlock the door before time runs out.

Sudoku is a popular game that involves placing numbers in a 9x9 grid. The goal of the game is to fill the grid so that each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid contains the numbers 1 through 9, with no repetition.
