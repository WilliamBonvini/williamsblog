### High Level Overview

As an original team member of [My-Formula](https://my-formula.it), I worked closely with the founder during the company's early stages.  
My-Formula is a cosmetics company that offers personalized hair products based on one's habits and characteristics.  
In particular, I provided consultancy on the website development side, implemented the personalization algorithm, worked on the cloud infrastructure, and delivered aggregate reports on customers' behaviour on a regular basis.
