  I was born in 1996 in Milan and lived almost my whole life in northern Italy. I studied *Computer Science* at *Politecnico di Milano*, where I graduated in April 2021.  
  I particularly enjoyed my time at Politecnico, where I found a very collaborative environment and developed a taste for writing scientific material.
