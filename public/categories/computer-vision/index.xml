      <description>High level overview Multi-model fitting is the task of retrieving several parametric models in unstructured data possibly contaminated by noise and outliers. This problem arises in many Computer Vision applications like the estimation of planes and primitives in architectural imagery and the recovery of multiple geometric transformations from stereo images.
In this work we propose a novel Deep Learning architecture for solving multi-model fitting problems in an unsupervised fashion, relying on a consensus maximization formulation.</description>
