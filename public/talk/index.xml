      <description>Overview EESTEC (Electrical Engineering STudents&amp;rsquo; European assoCiation) organizes an engineering competition every year.
In 2022 the competition topic was machine learning applications, so my colleagues at Machine Learning Reply and I organized a hackathon for them: An image classification task on 3D printed objects.
Dataset The dataset comprised of images of objects created via a 3D printer.
Some objects were defect free, some others presented well known types of 3D printer defects.</description>
